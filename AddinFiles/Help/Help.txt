Set up odbc connections to archive server

- Set up connection to pi server in PI SDK or other software, verify connection to server
- Open ODBC Data Sources (search for ODBC in start), pick 32 or 64 bit based on the installation of JMP
- Add a new User or System DSN
- Pick PI ODBC Driver and click finish
- In the box that opens:
  - ODBC Data Source
    - *Name* - Any name for the odbc source, for example "Plant1 PI Archive"
	- *Description* - Can be blank
  - PI SQL Data Access Server
	- *Name* - The local computer name (where DAS, ODBC, and OLEDB software was installed)
  - Data Source Tab
    - *Type* - PI OLEDB Provider
	- *PI Data Archive* - The name of the PI server or collective, (match what is in SDK)
	- *Initial catalog* - piarchive

Note that adding connections to PI servers and setting up ODBC data sources can be automated and deployed silently.
